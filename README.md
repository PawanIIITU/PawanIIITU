        <h5>How is Indian cricket team lossing again and again?</h5>
        
        <p>India have not good bowlers and fielders. They are playing rough cricket.They need to perform well.I think India needs proper management.
            Recently India have lost their test series too.There were some conflicts between Indian cricket and players.All the players 
            are confused since Virat Kohli stepped down from Captain position in all formats.Players are not taking responsibility to its level.
            Specially India is facing middle order problem.None of Indian guys are looking in form since Rohit sharma injury.This is one of great 
            problem.

            <p>India is facing some drastic situation due covid-19 since last two year.Our education system has fully damaged.We are losing our help again and again.We think we will get current situation right as soon as possible.
                Many people's life are turned to poor.They are mostly becoming victims due to this current situation.Most of people lost their parents
                and their loving ones.We are hoping soon it will get finished but our all expectations again turned into wake of other variant.
                Recently,Omicron has come as virus.Vaccination program were run but it is not 100% assurance for us.
